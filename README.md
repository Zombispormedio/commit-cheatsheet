> Help to follow a commit convention

## About

After a long time thinking, I decided to mix two commit conventions, [gitemoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) and [Angular commit guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit), to use in my commit messages.

I don't remember all the emojis and types and when to use them.

So I created this website in order to know at a glance which emojis or types I have to write in commit message.

## Features

- Searchable Emojis from [gitemoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/)
- Types from [Angular commit guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commi) and some add-ons
- Copy emojis and types to clipboard
- Responsive

## Built with

- [react](https://reactjs.org) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) - Blazing fast modern site generator for React
- [emotion](https://emotion.sh/) - A performant and flexible CSS-in-JS library
- [typography.js](https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/) - A powerful toolkit for building websites with beautiful design.
